# Training & Placement Officer (TPO) Desk

## Message from TPO
> At Hailakandi Polytechnic, we are deeply committed to preparing our students not only with strong academic foundations but also with the practical exposure and industry insights necessary for their professional growth. We believe that education goes beyond classrooms and textbooks; it is about building bridges between students and the dynamic world of work. That is why we continuously strive to establish collaborations with industry leaders, reputed organizations, and skill-development platforms to bring real-world opportunities to our learners. Through internships, industrial visits, placement drives, workshops, and interactive sessions with experts, our students gain first-hand knowledge of workplace requirements and emerging technologies. These engagements not only enhance their technical competencies but also help them develop communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills that are vital in todayâ€™s competitive job market. By fostering such an environment, we aim to empower every student with the confidence, adaptability, and industry-ready skills needed to embark on a successful career path and contribute meaningfully to the growth of society and the nation.
